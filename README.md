# A parser combinator hands on

based on [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton.

Start by checking out branch `part1`.

Implement all incomplete functions and make sure all tests pass. Then proceed to `part2` until `part5`.

The complete code can be found in branch `complete`.

Please note that this is still work in progress. Documentation and tests needs to be improved. Some property tests will fail sometimes due to inefficient generator implementations.
