# A parser combinator hands on

based on [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton.

Implement all incomplete functions marked with `???` and make sure all tests pass.

If all tests pass proceed to part 3:

    git checkout part3
    
(you have to commit or reset your changes)
