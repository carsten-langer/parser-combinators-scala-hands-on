# A parser combinator hands on

based on [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton.

## Part 1 - Basic parsers

Implement all incomplete functions marked with `???` and make sure all tests pass.

If all tests pass proceed to part 2:

    git checkout part2
    
(you have to commit or reset your changes)
